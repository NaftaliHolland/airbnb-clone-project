# Airbnb Clone Project

<!-- Overview of project -->
## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the functionality of a modern booking platform like Airbnb. The project's primary goal is to provide hands-on experience in building scalable, and production-ready systems while reinforcing the principles of collaborative software development.

Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of backend architecture, database design, API development, and deployment workflows. I'll be exploring how different technologies integrage to create a cohesive system that can support real-world use cases such as use authentication, property listings and booking management.
