<!-- AIRBNB CLONE -->

# Airbnb Clone Project

<!-- Overview of project -->
## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the functionality of a modern booking platform like Airbnb. The project's primary goal is to provide hands-on experience in building scalable, and production-ready systems while reinforcing the principles of collaborative software development.

Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of backend architecture, database design, API development, and deployment workflows. I'll be exploring how different technologies integrage to create a cohesive system that can support real-world use cases such as use authentication, property listings and booking management.

<!-- Project goals -->
## Project Goals
- Learn full-stack architecture by designing and implementing a functional booking system from the ground up.
- Gain practical experience with backend frameworks, database design, and API development.
- Apply secure development practices to protect data and ensure system integrity.
- Automate workflows using CI/CD pipelines for efficient testing and deployment.
- Collaborate using Github to simulate professional development environments.
